**Joan in Flames** is built on the principle that historical figures can serve as **activating symbols** rather than passive monuments. The experience is designed to:

- **Awaken Inner Rebellion** - Help users connect with their own capacity for truth-telling

- **Create Visceral Connection** - Use immersive media to make historical inspiration tangible

## 🔮 Symbolic Elements

### Fire Symbolism
Fire in this experience represents **transformation rather than destruction** - ideas burning away falsehood to reveal truth.

### Voice Symbolism  
The floating orbs represent the "voices" Joan heard, reimagined as fragments of universal wisdom available to all.

### Sword Symbolism
The weapon represents **words sharpened by truth** - the idea that authentic speech can cut through deception.

### Mirror Symbolism
The reflection shows not your physical appearance but your **insurgent potential** - who you could become if you embraced your own calling.
